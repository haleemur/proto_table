## Prototype of a pivot table application in pure python

## Features:

### The following features have been successfully demonstrated, but are not robust yet:

* construct `Table` object from dictionary
* construct `Table` object from csv
* print the `Table` object
* create indexes on columns
* group by columns
* perform aggregate operations on a grouped `Table` object
* display raw `Table` data to console
* display summary table data from a grouped `Table` object

### The following features need implementing

* reshaping a grouped `Table` object, i.e. pivot table
* data ordering
* filtering
